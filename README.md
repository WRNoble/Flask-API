# Project Title

This Project is the final individual project with GA and the first done in Python.  The project is to acquire API data, transfer it to  PostgreSQL database, and then perform create and read methods on it. The project has taken the data from The Movie Database website and has "fetch" the collection data for the nine Star Wars movies.  Other standalone movies have been added to the database separately demonstrating the that the create method function properly.  

## Getting Started

This project is built with Python and for that reason has no front in functionality.  However, the program, can be used through the terminal on a user's computer.  

### Prerequisites

The user will need to have knowledge of both their computer's terminal and SQL query methods.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Deployment

The user should acquire this from my GitHub page and then work on their computer's terminal to operate the program.
